A school management system, but Islām-focused

## Roadmap
This will start off by being a system to manage a school of Qur-ān ḥifẓ classes. The first focus will be on managing and tracking attendance and performance of students; part of the performance will be the completion of a student's homework so naturally that will be managed too.
